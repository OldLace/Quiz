Explanations of the technologies used
HTML, Javascript, and jQuery were used. I researched jQuery UI,but didn’t get beyond that with it.

##Approach taken
My idea was to get a prototype question up and running. At first, for it to appear on screen, followed by the input method. From there, work on functionality of transitioning to additional questions. Major functionality like tracking of right and wrong answers would have been the next goal. Finally, styling and then other extra bells and whistles.

##Struggle
I didn’t identify and deal with my overall struggles early enough in the process.I certainly didn’t start the assignment late, as I had ideas and was excited from the get-go. Granted starting over probably wasn’t my brightest idea. I should have also taken my time to take on a project I was more passionate about.
